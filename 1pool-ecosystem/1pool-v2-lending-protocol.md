# 1Pool V2: Lending protocol

##  Multi-chain lending protocol for LP tokens

Most existing platforms offer  lending and borrowing on stand-alone digital assets \(such as borrowing USDT/USDC against BTC or ETH collaterals\).

 Whereas the users of 1pool can use selected Liquidity pairs, initially of Uniswap and Sushiswap exchanges, as collateral and take a loan.

 By doing so, the user \(borrower\) will still have the liquidity rewards entitled to their collateral, which can be used to pay the loan interest in full or in part. This effectively enables the users to further monetize their LP pairs.
