# Potential Risk factors and Vulnerabilities

  
1POOL is a work in progress. Being a new project in a relatively new and evolving sphere of decentralized finances, the users should take note of potential vulnerabilities, some which is outlined below, when using the platform.

**Potential smart contract exploits:** 1pool is a new project and there can exist smart contract vulnerabilities. We will conduct a full Smart contract audit before the formal launch and update the community accordingly. Using the platform before the audit is strongly discouraged.

Though audits could mitigate the risk, it does not negate the possibility of unforeseen bugs which could be exploited by the unscrupulous actors. The users should be mindful of these risks when using the platform.

**Financial Risks:** Cryptocurrency is subject to extreme price fluctuations and potential manipulation. Users can lose substantially during such occurances. Please be aware of such risks and do your own research before you invest. Do not invest your lifesavings on cryptocurrency.
