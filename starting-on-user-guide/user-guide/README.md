# Let's get started!

Now that you have done your own research and want to try out 1Pool.finance, here is a brief user guide to help you. This is neither extensive nor exclusive but can serve as a basic guide if you are new to Defi or cryptocurrency in general. 

**FIRST THING FIRST**: your private keys are your ownership of your digital assets. You lose or compromise your private keys, you are most likely to lose your funds.   
\*\*NEVER, in any situation, should you ever give someone your private key or recovery phrase \("seed phrase"\). This will give someone complete access to your crypto!

\*\* Securely store your seed phrase. The Secret Recovery Phrase is a **unique 12-word phrase generated when you first set up** MetaMask or Binance Chain Wallet.  Your funds are connected to that phrase. If you ever lose your password, your Secret Recovery Phrase allows you to recover your wallet and your funds.

1POOL team  will never ask for your private key or  your seed phrase.\*\*

With that cautionary note, let's get started!.
